In this second task at prodigy infotech, I created a Python-based image encryption and decryption tool. The program prompts users to input the image file path and their preferred encryption key. Utilizing pixel manipulation techniques, the tool encrypts or decrypts the image based on the user's preferred selection. This application provides a secure and user-friendly solution for protecting sensitive visual information.
